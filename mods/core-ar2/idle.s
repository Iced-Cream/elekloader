| core-ar2 0.14: the silent-voice skip's site (idle.c has the rules).
|
| 0x40121208, in the render's slot loop (0x40121152): `movea.l
| (0,%a5,%d4.l),%a1; tst.l %a1`, before stock's `beq.b 0x40121248`, which
| skips the slot's machine call when %a1 is 0. Live here: %d0 the slot's
| owner track, %d2 the slot, %d4 the slot x 4, %a2 the slot's parameter
| pointer (0x419ca0f0 + %d4), %a5 the machine pointers (0x419ca110), %d7 the
| tracks' flag bytes (0x8000ea18), %a4 the tracks' pitches (0x80006388).
| %d1, %d6 and %a0 are free (stock reloads them). The site returns %a1 and
| its flags: 0 takes stock's skip, the pointer runs the call.
|
| Off (core_voice_skip_want 0, the boot's value, or core_voice_skip_hold
| above 0) the site is stock's two instructions and a few tests: the slot's
| watch is forgotten, a slot that was skipped gets its call again from this
| block, and its digital state still goes back to the boot's at its next
| SYN trig (core_voice_off).
|
| On, the busy path, a voice whose machine gain is above 2^-19 of full scale
| (|gain| >= 0x1000 in either of the slot's gain words, 0x80007000 + 8 x
| slot), is a dozen instructions: it forgets the slot's watch and returns
| the pointer.
