/* core-ar2 0.14: the silent-voice skip (README, "The silent-voice skip
 * (0.14)"). Every address is OS 1.74's.
 *
 * The render calls one machine routine per voice slot (8 slots) every block
 * through 0x419ca110, from the slot's first SYN trig until the power goes
 * off, whether the voice sounds or not. Core stops calling it once the slot
 * is silent and its call changes nothing the voice board gets (or only what
 * a machine below is let off), and at the slot's next SYN trig puts the
 * slot's digital state back to what the boot left, so that note starts as
 * the first one after a power-on does.
 *
 * Only while a mod asks for it and none holds it off (core_voice_skip_want
 * nonzero, core_voice_skip_hold 0; analog-rytm-mk2/voice.h); off, the site
 * is stock's (idle.s).
 *
 * Watched (idle.s tests the gain first, then core_voice_quiet), cheapest
 * first; all of these, every block:
 *   - the machine's gain, both words, below 0x1000 (2^-19 of full scale,
 *     -114 dB): the machine's digital part (noise, click) is gone;
 *   - the recorded machine is a public one (0..33) and not CP CLASSIC (6),
 *     whose generator is a global one; machines mods add (34 up) keep state
 *     core can't know;
 *   - no trig of the owner, and the machine's own sequence done or not
 *     waiting for its timer (state < 0, or timer +4 below 0x10);
 *   - the slot's analog amp envelope (0x4010d0fc's sequence, 0x42fb49b4 +
 *     0x20 x slot) in its decay (3) or release (5), for twice the time
 *     stock's own rate-to-time routine (0x4011e7d6) gives for that rate from
 *     full level, plus 375 blocks (0.25 s), against the rate it has now;
 *   - nothing the call reads changed since the last block: the owner track's
 *     0x54-byte parameter block, its pitch, the owner, the idle bit, the
 *     pointers and the machine's sequence state.
 * Then core makes the call itself for QUIET_BLOCKS blocks and checks that it
 * changes nothing in the control frame (0x800063c0, 0x3d8 bytes) or the
 * slot's sequence record (0x8000fef8 + 0x20 x slot: state, timer and the
 * machine's private words), leaves both gain words as they were, and leaves
 * the slot's click buffer (0x80006bf8 + 0x80 x slot) at zero. Passed:
 *   - a byte set from 0 in a place the render clears after each send (byte
 *     +4 of entries 0x15..0x4c, 8 bytes apart, 0x401214d8), the same bytes
 *     every call, at most REPLAY of them, which core writes again in each
 *     skipped block;
 *   - BD PLASTIC, SD NATURAL, BD SHARP and BD ACOUSTIC (21, 23, 26, 30): their
 *     private record words (+8..+0x1c), an envelope that keeps decaying, which
 *     stay where they are while skipped (owner's pick, 2026-11-09);
 *   - XT CLASSIC (8) on slots 3 and 5: its ring-out words (frame +0x7a/+0x7c,
 *     +0x7e/+0x80), which stay where they are while skipped (owner's pick).
 * A call that changes anything else (SY CHIP's arpeggio counter) is left to
 * stock for BLOCKED_BLOCKS blocks before core looks again.
 *
 * Skipped, a block costs a few loads: a trig of the owner, a new owner, a
 * new sequence state or idle bit gives the slot back to stock in that block.
 * Everything else, a knob, an LFO, a kit's values, reaches the voice at the
 * next check: every PROBE_BLOCKS blocks core makes the call and checks it as
 * above, and a change gives the slot back to stock.
 *
 * At the next SYN trig (flag bit 7 of 0x8000e53c) of a slot that was
 * skipped, just before stock's call for that note, its generator and filter
 * struct (0x80007e20 + 0x2c x slot), gain words, resonator buffer
 * (0x80007040 + 0x80 x slot), the machine's private record words
 * (+8..+0x1c) and for slot 7 the two RS words at 0x80007f6c go back to the
 * snapshot core takes at the render's first block. A SYN-off trig resets
 * nothing, as in stock.
