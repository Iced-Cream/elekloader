/* core-ar2 0.14: the FX skip (README, "The FX skip (0.14)"). Every address
 * is OS 1.74's.
 *
 * The FX block 0x4010e6bc builds the two send buses, calls the delay
 * 0x4010da24 (at 0x4010e7c4), adds the delay into the reverb's bus and calls
 * the reverb 0x4010d434 (at 0x4010e81e), every block, whether anything is
 * sent or not. Both routines leave the MAC unit as they found it (MACSR 0xa0,
 * the accumulators cleared), so a call left out leaves it the same.
 *
 * Three switches (analog-rytm-mk2/fx.h), off at boot and written only by the
 * mod that offers them as settings; core_fx_skip_hold holds all off:
 *   - core_fx_skip_want: the send trim (fx.s) and the delay skip. Exact: the
 *     output is stock's, bit for bit.
 *   - core_reverb_clear_want (with core_fx_skip_want): the reverb clear and
 *     skip. Not exact: stock's reverb, once it has had any input, never
 *     decays to 0 (a limit cycle about +-117 of full scale 2^31, which leaves
 *     main L at -1), so core clears it once it is that quiet and then skips
 *     it; its next tail starts from silence, as after a power-on.
 *   - core_delay_clear_want (with core_fx_skip_want): the delay clear. Not
 *     exact, for the same reason (below).
 *
 * The delay, skipped while all of these hold:
 *   - its bus (0x80007a44, 32 stereo frames) is 0;
 *   - its parameters (0x8000fbaa..0x8000fbbb) are those of its last call, and
 *     that call changed none of its state (0x8000ca00..0x8000ca0f,
 *     0x8000dff0..0x8000e12b: input gains, gate, time, filter, the tap's
 *     scratch) and wrote 0 to its output (0x80007c44) and to the staging
 *     block (*0x8000ddb0, 0x100 bytes) that the eDMA writes into the line;
 *   - for LINE_BLOCKS blocks no call has written anything but 0 into the line:
 *     the write position (0x8000e1c8) moves 32 frames a block round a line of
 *     512K frames, so the whole 4 MB line is 0, and a call would read 0.
 * A skipped block leaves the staging block as the eDMA prefetched it, from
 * the line, so 0 goes back into the line, as a call would write.
 *
 * Stock's delay, once it has had input, never decays to exactly 0 either (its
 * output keeps a few hundred of 2^31), so that rule alone holds only until the
 * delay is first fed. core_delay_clear_want (with core_fx_skip_want) adds a
 * clear, like the reverb's: input 0 and nothing at or above D_QUIET_PEAK (4 LSB
 * of 24 bits) written into the line or the output for LINE_BLOCKS blocks, so
 * the whole line is that quiet; then core clears the line (0x4b400000, 4 MB,
 * D_CLEAR_CHUNK bytes a block) and the audio state, without the call, and the
 * rule above takes over. Not exact: the next echo tail starts from silence.
 * A first call after a clear that writes anything but 0 is a failure; after
 * MAX_FAILS, no clear again until the input moves. The time, gains and
 * parameter state (0x8000e008..0x8000e01b, 0x8000ca00..) are left as they are.
 *
 * The reverb, on its bus (0x80007b44) after the delay's add:
 *   RUN     stock's call. Input 0 for QUIET_BLOCKS blocks with the output
 *           below QUIET_PEAK (1 LSB of 24 bits) all along: CLEAR.
 *   CLEAR   no call (input 0, so the bus, its output in place, stays 0); each
 *           block clears its state words (those its boot init 0x4010dfd8
 *           clears, and its SRAM blocks and scratch, 0x8000cc3c..0x8000ccbb and
 *           0x8000d1f0..0x8000dd03, which the eDMA moves to and from the
 *           lines) and CLEAR_CHUNK bytes of its lines (0x4b000000, 0x98000
 *           bytes). Then VERIFY.
 *   VERIFY  stock's call, from the cleared state: the output must stay exactly
 *           0 for VERIFY_BLOCKS blocks (two turns of the 64 KB lines), else
 *           RUN (after MAX_FAILS failures, not again until the input moves).
 *           Then SKIP.
 *   SKIP    no call while the input is 0: from a cleared state with input 0
 *           the call changes nothing (its LFO and line positions run outside
 *           it, at 0x4010e420 and 0x4010e822, and only move reads of 0).
 *           In CLEAR and SKIP core keeps the call's tap position
 *           (0x8000cc2c) current, as the call would.
 * Input that is not 0 gives the reverb back to stock (RUN) in that block. */
