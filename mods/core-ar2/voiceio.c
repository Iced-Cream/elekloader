/* core-ar2 (sidecar-voice-io): track mutes and DIN MIDI out for mods
 * (OS 1.74). The voice note-off getter, core_voice_released, is beside
 * the trig latch in machines.c.
 *
 * Track mutes. The project settings model is the app's +0x30 (the object
 * core_current_track reads, 0x400ae492). Its data's +0x20 holds the track
 * mutes, bit t for track t (0..12); 0x400b6d94(model, t) reads a bit and
 * 0x400b6dd8(model, t, on) sets one and tells the model's observers
 * (ProjectSettingsTrackMuteChangedInfo), as an Overbridge or SysEx settings
 * write does: the engine's copy (0x4011f99e writes 0x8000ed98 from the
 * data's +0x20) and the screens follow. It sends no MIDI, where the mute
 * key's setter (0x400b78d8) may also send CC 94 or an NRPN.
 *
 * DIN MIDI out. Stock's DIN sender 0x40001dea(len, msg) waits while its
 * 4 KB DMA ring lacks room, then copies the whole message into the ring
 * with every interrupt masked and starts the DMA or leaves the bytes for
 * the running one. core_midi_din_try_send checks the same room with
 * interrupts masked and calls it only when the message fits, so it never
 * waits; a message goes out whole, between two of stock's (clock, notes,
 * the sequencer's MIDI tracks). The port must be a MIDI port: OUT PORT
 * FUNC (the settings data's +0x60, 0x400b5424) is cached at ev_tick, and
 * DIN24 or DIN48 refuses.
