/* smpl-machines: SMPL machines on the Analog Rytm MKII (mods/smpl-machines,
 * docs/ADAPTING.md "SMPL machines (smpl-machines, Analog Rytm MKII)").
 *
 * The SMPL page's eight knobs are the sound's indices 17..24 (records 39..46:
 * TUN, FIN, SMP, BR, STA, END, LOP, LEV), stock's sample layer, shared by
 * every SRC machine. A SMPL machine takes the page over for the sounds that
 * run it: its own title, knob labels, names, looks, ranges and value texts,
 * on stock's records, so the values are still the sound's own words: they
 * store, p-lock, slide and take the LFO and MIDI as stock's do. While a
 * sound runs one, stock's sample layer stays silent on its voice, and the
 * machine's engine, if it has one, gets the words each audio block. Stock's
 * sample playback is machine 0, so a sound that names none is unchanged.
 *
 * A machine's page shows its knobs in record order, so knob C is SMP's word
 * (index 19, CC 27), where stock's page shows BR. It is the sound's sample
 * slot: a move never writes it, and what it holds is the sample stock plays.
 * Leave it blank, or use it for something that follows the sample.
 *
 * A mod adds machines through the table smpl_machines, and asks the
 * framework for their ids by count; the build's lockfile keeps them, so a
 * saved sound finds its machine again. In mod.json:
 *
 *     "pool_ids": {"smpl_machines": 1},
 *     "contribute": [
 *       {"to": "smpl_machines", "order": 50, "data": "00000000",
 *        "relocs": [[0, "abs32", "sym:my_smpl", 0]]}],
 *     "requires": ["core", "smpl-machines"]
 *
 * and in C:
 *
 *     SMPL_MACHINES;
 *     const struct smpl_machine my_smpl = {
 *         SMPL_MACHINE(0), "PLAITS 2", "PLT2", CORE_VOICE_BD | CORE_VOICE_SD, SMPL_REQUIRED, 0,
 *         CORE_MACHINE(0), my_engine,
 *         {{"HRM", "Harmonics", 0, 0, 127 << 8, 64 << 8}, ...}};
 *
 * Which machine a sound runs: the one its SRC machine requires (bind
 * SMPL_REQUIRED and src the SRC machine's slot), else the sound's own choice
 * in the sound setup menu's SMPL MACHINE row (kept in a sound field of
 * smpl-machines'), whose AUTO is the one its SRC machine names as
 * SMPL_DEFAULT, or stock's. A machine whose voices leave out the track's
 * voice is not offered there, and a sound that names it plays stock's.
 *
 * The engine runs in the audio interrupt, once a block for each voice whose
 * owner track plays a sound that runs the machine (a sound-locked step's
 * pool sound included), before stock's sample layer:
 *
 *     void engine(int32_t voice, int32_t track, const int16_t *words, int32_t trig)
 *
 * words[k] is the track's engine word for sound index 17 + k (knob k, after
 * p-locks, slides and the LFO), value << 8 with the fine part in the low
 * byte; trig is 1 when the voice's sample layer would have started this
 * block (a trig of the track). Keep it short; plain reads. */
