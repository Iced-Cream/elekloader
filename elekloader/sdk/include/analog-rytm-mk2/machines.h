/* core-ar2 0.5: machines mods add (docs/ADAPTING.md, "Machines (core-ar2 0.5,
 * Analog Rytm MKII)"). The Rytm has 53 machine slots; 34..52 are hidden
 * factory machines (mask 0: no voice may pick them). A mod takes one of
 * slots 34..52 (44..52 from core 0.13) through the table core_machines,
 * contributed in mod.json:
 *
 *     "contribute": [
 *       {"to": "core_machines", "order": 50, "data": "00000000",
 *        "relocs": [[0, "abs32", "sym:my_machine", 0]]}],
 *     "resources": {"core": "0.5"}
 *
 * elekloader names the entry's slot as the resource "machine:<slot>" (the
 * profile's slot_claims), so two mods that take the same slot are refused.
 * At boot, before the OS reads them, core writes each entry's engine, home
 * track, voice mask and names into the machine table, and its knobs' labels,
 * maximum and default into the slot's parameter records. A record keeps its
 * id, its slot in the sound (indices 9..16, LEV first) and its MIDI CC and
 * NRPN, so a sound stores the knobs as it stores any machine's. A knob
 * whose name is 0 keeps the stock record as it is. Slots 35..42 (the hidden
 * "2" machines) have all eight records; 34 (BT IMPROVED) and 43 (FUNC. GEN.)
 * have five (LEV and four more), and a knob with no record is ignored.
 *
 * From core 0.13 the TEST machines' slots 44..52 are offered too (ask for
 * "core": "0.13"). Their records have no MIDI of their own: core gives each
 * record a mod knob uses CC 16 + k and NRPN 1:k (k = sound index - 9), as
 * the hidden machines 34..42 have. They have fewer records:
 *
 *     44 BD TEST   9..16 (all eight)     49 MT TEST   9..12
 *     45 SD TEST   9..12, 15, 16         50 HH TEST   9..13, 16
 *     46 RS TEST   9..16 (all eight)     51 CY TEST   9..16 (all eight)
 *     47 BT TEST   9..13                 52 CB TEST   10..12, 16 (no LEV)
 *     48 LT TEST   9..12
 *
 * From core 0.15 a filled TEST slot shows its knobs in the public order,
 * knobs[1..7] on A..G and LEV on H (stock's TEST pages put LEV on A and the
 * rest in each test's own order), and CORE_MACHINE_LOOKS (below) gives a
 * knob a stock knob's look in place of the test machine's.
 *
 * Mods that used these records as spare parameters (fx-sends, duck,
 * voice-dac) move off them for 0.13; one that still uses a slot's records
 * declares "machine:<n>" in its resources, so the linker refuses it next to
 * a machine in that slot. The value's text and the knob's turn can be
 * changed through core_params (pages.h).
 *
 * A kit or sound that names the machine loads on a build without the mod (or
 * on stock) with that sound's machine set to DISABLE: stock's kit load does
 * that for any machine its voice may not run.
 *
 * The engine is called once per 32-frame audio block for each physical voice
 * running the machine, as stock's are (the audio interrupt):
 *
 *     void engine(int32_t voice, void *frame, uint16_t *blk, int32_t pitch)
 *
 * frame is the analog control frame (0x800063c0), blk the track's parameter
 * block (word k is sound index 9 + k, so word 0 is LEV), pitch the note. An
 * engine may run a stock engine (CORE_ENGINE_*) with a block of its own.
 *
 * From core 0.13 the engine table holds core's trampoline, which calls the
 * mod's engine after latching, for the voice, what the interrupt's trig
 * intake set for its owner track this block (the intake runs before the
 * engines):
 *
 *     core_voice_trigged(voice)   1 when the track trigged this block, else 0
 *     core_voice_velocity(voice)  the track's velocity word (0x800067c4 + 2t),
 *                                 before accent
 *     core_voice_released(voice)  1 when the track's note was released this
 *                                 block (pad, key or MIDI note-off, the
 *                                 note's length, the sequencer), 2 when
 *                                 stock cut every track at once (the kit
 *                                 and project loads do), else 0. Stock's
 *                                 stop and the loads send a note-off to
 *                                 every track, so an end can come for a
 *                                 note that already ended: a mod that
 *                                 needs one end per note keeps its own
 *                                 flag.
 *
 * Call them from the engine, for its own voice: they read the latch of the
 * voice's last call, so outside it they hold that call's values. Plain
 * reads, no locks.
