 * core-ar2 0.14: the silent-voice skip's switch (mods/core-ar2/idle.c,
 * mods/core-ar2/README.md, "The silent-voice skip (0.14)").
 *
 * The skip runs only when a mod asks for it and no mod holds it off:
 * core_voice_skip_want nonzero and core_voice_skip_hold 0. It is off at boot.
 * It changes the sound slightly (a silent voice's next note starts from its
 * power-on state), so the mod that offers it as a setting writes the user's
 * choice into core_voice_skip_want; nothing else writes it. A byte, read once
 * per slot per audio block, so any context may write it at any time.
 *
 * A mod that needs stock's exact render while it works (one that reads a
 * voice's machine state, or measures stock's load) calls
 * core_voice_skip_hold_add() when it starts and core_voice_skip_hold_release()
 * when it ends, once each: core_voice_skip_hold counts the holds. Each call is
 * one instruction, so any context may call them.
 *
 * Off by either path, a slot that was skipped gets its machine call again
 * from the next audio block, and its digital state still goes back to the
 * boot's at its next SYN trig.
